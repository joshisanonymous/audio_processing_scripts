# This script is meant to automatically apply SoX noise reduction to any number of audio recordings,
# specifically those of speech, that are in a single directory. It ignores recordings that contain
# absolute silence but otherwise generates noise profiles from portions of silence in rest that are
# then used to apply noise reduction. To adjust settings for silence detection be adjusted to be more
# or less conservative, search for "silencedetect" and modify the values after n= (amplitude ratio for
# the threshold) and d= (duration of silence to count as silence). To adjust settings for how severe
# the noise reduction should be, search for "noisered" and adjust the value at the end of the line,
# ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 where 1.0 is more reduction and 0.0 is less. -Josh McNeill
