This repo contains various scripts used to perform (usually batch) audio
processing, each directory representing a different project. Scripts are
in whichever language I was playing with at the time or that seemed
appropriate.

* noise_reduction: Uses FFmpeg and SoX to batch apply noise reduction
* snr_calculation: Uses an old Unix signal-to-noise calculator to calculate SNRs
